## Features

- **Arithmetic Operations:** Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of two numbers.  
- **Keypad Input:** User-friendly interface using a 4x4 keypad for input.  
- **LCD Display:** Results are displayed in real-time on a standard 16x2 LCD.  
- **Memory Utilization:** Stores inputs and results in dedicated memory locations within the microcontroller.  
- **Simulation and Coding:** Circuit designed in Proteus, and the code developed using MIDE-51 IDE.

## Implementation Details  

### **8051 Microcontroller:**  
- Controls the keypad, processes inputs, executes arithmetic operations, and displays the output.  

### **Keypad Scanning:**  
- Continuously scans the 4x4 keypad matrix to detect pressed keys and identify inputs.  

### **LCD Integration:**  
- Displays inputs, operations, and results in ASCII format on a 16x2 LCD module.  

### **Proteus Simulation:**  
- Circuit simulated in Proteus software, ensuring proper functionality before hardware implementation.  

### **Code Compilation:**  
- Program written in Assembly language using MIDE-51 IDE, converted into a `.hex` file, and uploaded to the microcontroller.
