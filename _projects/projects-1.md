This project focuses on building a facemask detection system using CNN and deep learning techniques. The model was trained using TensorFlow and Keras, achieving high accuracy for real-time predictions. It takes input from images or live video streams to classify if a facemask is present.

### Features
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN):** For extracting essential image features.
- **Real-time Detection:** Operates on live video streams or image inputs.
- **Accuracy:** Reliable detection with optimized model architecture.
- **Deep Learning Frameworks:** TensorFlow and Keras were used for training and testing.
