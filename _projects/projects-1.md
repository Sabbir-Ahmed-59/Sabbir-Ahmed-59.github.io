## Real-time Facemask Detection using CNN & Deep Learning

This project focuses on building a facemask detection system using CNN and deep learning techniques. The model was trained using TensorFlow and Keras, achieving high accuracy for real-time predictions. It takes input from images or live video streams to classify if a facemask is present.

### Features
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN):** For extracting essential image features.
- **Real-time Detection:** Operates on live video streams or image inputs.
- **Accuracy:** Reliable detection with optimized model architecture.
- **Deep Learning Frameworks:** TensorFlow and Keras were used for training and testing.

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
