This thesis addresses the challenges in designing and optimizing 5G networks using the **Atoll** tool. The project involved planning a 5G network for a specific area and optimizing its performance metrics. The work was conducted independently during the **COVID-19 pandemic**, with the Atoll software learned from scratch.

### Features
- **Efficient Network Design:** Installed a minimal number of base stations (**19 gNB**) for the selected area while ensuring coverage requirements were met.  
- **Performance Optimization:** Enhanced area coverage by **8.96% in RSRP** and **2.54% in RSRQ**, reducing overlap and maximizing efficiency.  
- **High-Quality Signal Metrics:** Achieved **90.09% RSRP** and **93.05% RSRQ** for uplink and downlink signals, demonstrating robust network quality.

### Implementation Details
- **Atoll Network Planning Tool:** Used Atoll to model the 5G network, calculate coverage, and evaluate performance metrics.  
- **Optimization Techniques:** Focused on reducing signal overlap while improving overall area coverage and signal quality.  
- **Base Station Deployment:** Strategically installed **19 gNB** to minimize infrastructure while ensuring connectivity.  
- **Signal Evaluation Metrics:** Analyzed **RSRP** (Reference Signal Received Power) and **RSRQ** (Reference Signal Received Quality) for coverage optimization. 

### Future Prospects
- Expanding the study to include **3D modeling** of urban environments for more accurate network planning.  
- Incorporating **machine learning** for automated optimization of coverage and quality metrics.  
- Exploring the impact of advanced antenna systems like **Massive MIMO** on network performance.
